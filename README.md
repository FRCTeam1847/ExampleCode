# ExampleCode

This is where we will have example code that works with our current components. As well as experiments we have tested and may use in the future.

## Getting Started

We will assume the following has happened in order to get started:

1. Setup your machine for Java by following the [zero to robot](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/introduction.html) guide.
   - Specifically follow [Step 2](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/index.html) to install
     1. [FRC Game Tools](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/frc-game-tools.html)
     2. [WPILib](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/wpilib-setup.html)

## Examples

- ### KitBot Drive Examples
  These are starting examples of a kit bot using arcade drive and can drive forward in auto for 2 or 3 seconds depending on the selected command in ShuffleBoard.

    1.  [KitBotDriveTimedExample](KitBotDriveTimedExample/README.md)
    2.  [KitBotDriveCommandExample](KitBotDriveCommandExample) This is the same as the first just a command based approach
