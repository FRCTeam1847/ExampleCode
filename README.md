# ExampleCode

This is where we will have example code that works with our current components. As well as experiments we have tested and may use in the future. 


## Getting Started 
We will assume the following has happened in order to get started: 
1. Setup your machine for Java by following the [zero to robot](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/introduction.html) guide. 
    - Specifically follow [Step 2](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/index.html) to install
        1. [FRC Game Tools](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/frc-game-tools.html) 
        2. [WPILib](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/wpilib-setup.html)

## Examples
