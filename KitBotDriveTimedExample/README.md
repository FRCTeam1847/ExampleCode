# KitBotDriveExample

This is a starting point for a basic KitBot. The Kit Bot is the Andymark 6 wheel robot drive base that most teams have. It is also known as Tank Drive. Our robot set up consists of the following:

- Drive has 1-2 Motors on each side. 
- Motors use [TalonSRX](https://store.ctr-electronics.com/talon-srx/) as the motor controllers


# Features
- It uses the Timed Robot approach. 
- Has a selector that selects forward for 2 seconds or forward for 3 seconds during auto. 
- Drives using arcade drive. 

# Resources
Here are some of the resources you'll need if you are setting up a new project with this example. 

- Install the appropriate 3rd party libraries.
    - Since we are using a TalonSRX we need to install the Phoenix 5 and Phoenix 6 libraries. Instructions can be found here [FRC C++/Java - Add Phoenix](https://v5.docs.ctr-electronics.com/en/stable/ch05a_CppJava.html#frc-c-java-add-phoenix). 
    
        __Note__: If you do the online install you will need the link from [Phoenix Software](https://docs.ctr-electronics.com/) website under the `Downloads` -> `FRC C++/Java Vendordeps`.
